# Let's get started!!

# WARNING THIS REPO IS NOT YET FINISHED !!!
but feel free to enjoy the bugs xD
## Prep setup

### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode or whichever text-editor you feel more comfortable with. Maybe even vim or emacs. ^_^

### Tests

Since I'm no expert the testing is a little bit different with this repo. If you are working on 01-map.js you should run the following:

```javascript
npm test 01-map.test.js
```

If you are working on 02-filter.js you should run:

```javascript
npm test 02-filter.test.js
```
and so on...

WARNING!
I HAVE ONLY MANAGED TO GET UP TO 03-forEach.js
THE REST OF THE FILES WILL HAVE TO WAIT AFTER I FINISH WORKING!
FORK AND CLONE THIS REPO work on it as you like. I'll prolly finish by Friday night. If you wanna see me finish this up. Join me on Discord. I stream there nightly. Alone. </3
